With every passing moment we had a feeling to carry on looking forward to the days.</p>\n<p>As you can see the little growth, these are tomato plants.<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/3/31a1c0985b5552b53c687dc0f169fe4dba4a3fdd_2_281x500.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"753WPdSRpOTqTRDRrnHS2DTIkwt\" width=\"281\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/3/31a1c0985b5552b53c687dc0f169fe4dba4a3fdd_2_281x500.jpeg, https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/3/31a1c0985b5552b53c687dc0f169fe4dba4a3fdd_2_421x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/3/31a1c0985b5552b53c687dc0f169fe4dba4a3fdd_2_562x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"8E776F\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"aspect-ratio: 281 / 500;\"></div><p></p>\n<p>Besides tomatoes, gingers, potatoes and even sweet potatoes and onions we planted each one in their pot carefully and watered them all regularly, lead us to some growth.<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/e9a8e020a13d8a61947da0a9286c706b1d7b7e2b_2_281x500.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"xl340HRO3Zn3JdW9vIx6tNSFmvp\" width=\"281\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/e9a8e020a13d8a61947da0a9286c706b1d7b7e2b_2_281x500.jpeg, https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/e9a8e020a13d8a61947da0a9286c706b1d7b7e2b_2_421x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/e9a8e020a13d8a61947da0a9286c706b1d7b7e2b_2_562x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"837469\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"aspect-ratio: 281 / 500;

Establishing thing on a smaller scale, in your own place, also makes you the gardener. We got some little gardeners at La. Our garden is not that small but for the time, we only have little vegetables and crops growing. We take proper care to do some cleaning of the area, watering the plants, and cultivating the soil. In the first pictures. Not to forget we got bio-explore area as well and biology team like our little stars of home-garden who learns everyday, let us learn together when you come at LA.</p>\n<p>as the process continues, we’ll continue publishing more posts…</p>"
