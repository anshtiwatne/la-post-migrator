To foster curiosity and engagement, <strong>we introduced aquatic organisms like Moina (<a href=\"https://metastudio.org/t/biology-corner-of-living-academy/15193\">More about it in biocorner thread)</a> as dynamic learning tools on topics of frontier research or as simple as learning Physical, Chemical and Biological Interactions in Aquatic systems</strong>. Therefore, adding more members to the aquatic family can help us understand these interactions.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"video-placeholder-container\" data-video-src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7cf35eacc6dd0c2d42de072879d9cc6d040a96c0.mp4\" style=\"cursor: pointer;\">\n  <div class=\"video-placeholder-wrapper\"><div class=\"video-placeholder-overlay\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-play svg-icon svg-string\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><use href=\"#play\"></use></svg></div></div></div><br>\nIn K J Somaiya College, Mumbai, Zebrafish were being cultured by undergrad students for project work, and as the project was completed, they were handed over to CUBE.

In hurry of saving other fishes we didn’t click photos of dead fish. Sorry for that.

We cleaned up two tanks of ~10 liters volume. One for Zebrafish and another for Guppyfish. So, towards the start, you’ll see the connection of the aerator. And inside a big tank, there are 2 small tanks out of which in 2nd one you’ll see that there are 2 bags which contain the fishes</p>\n<div class=\"onebox video-onebox\">\n  <video width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" controls=\"\">\n    <source src=\"https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a1dbe965ed18969fbaad76ac673c0e1c0ba5d6e9.mp4\">\n    <a href=\"https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a1dbe965ed18969fbaad76ac673c0e1c0ba5d6e9.mp4\">\n      https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a1dbe965ed18969fbaad76ac673c0e1c0ba5d6e9.mp4\n    </a>\n  </video>\n</div>\n<p>\nWe are here acclimatizing the fish to a new water.

We put the labels and made a log book.</p>\n<p>Currently, they are being cultured by feeding fish food and Moina as live food. Soon, we can initiate discussions with students regarding research prospects and other relevant topics.</p>"
