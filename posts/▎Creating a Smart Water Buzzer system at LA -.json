So we did a project with students while teaching them about electronics. The purpose of this project was to create a water level alarm system. When the water tank is filled, it triggers the buzzer to beep when the water has reached a certain level. This helps in identifying when the tank is full. The project was done by the team of students who are the part of la in a regular basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Team Members :</strong></p>\n<p>The project involved Shahfiz, Adli, Faiz, and Aman, guided by Sumit. This group formed the new electrical team.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"project-overview-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#project-overview-2\"></a><strong>Project Overview :</strong></h2>\n<p>This was the first electrical circuit project for LA. The process began with drawing the circuit design and for the body of that buzzer to cover its mechanism, we used a plastic shampoo bottle and shaped it according to circuit and created a body like structure for the buzzer.</p>\n<p>Under Sumit’s guidance, the team learned how to build the circuit on a breadboard. They learned how to make a use of breadboard and a didgital-multimeter in making of a circuit for any project, how to check voltage  of a battery, use of digital-multimeter, and etc. Initially, the buzzer produced a loud sound, so we adjusted it accordingly, it was placed inside the shaped body of the buzzer helped in reducing noise levels. GN suggested modifying the sound to a beep with a buffer, which was successfully implemented.</p>\n<p>After constructing the circuit, we realized its versatility. They noted that instead of a buzzer, an LED light could be used, similar to circuits found in refrigerators have same machanism.</p>\n<p><strong>Ingredients :</strong></p>\n<p>• Box</p>\n<p>• 9-volt battery</p>\n<p>• Alarm buzzer</p>\n<p>• Wires</p>\n<p>• Breadboard</p>\n<p>• Digital multimeter</p>\n<p>• Glue gun</p>\n<h2><a name=\"process-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#process-3\"></a><strong>Process :</strong></h2>\n<p>The project began with creating a circuit design and gathering the necessary components. The breadboard was prepared by checking the negative and positive connections of the alarm circuit’s wire.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/6/5616846e318ba9c42470e7cad03db5de6458b63c_2_281x375.jpeg\" alt=\"Testing components.\" data-base62-sha1=\"chziWAJ0unJ5Nj90D2mHxYYtu2M\" width=\"281\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/6/5616846e318ba9c42470e7cad03db5de6458b63c_2_281x375.jpeg, https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/6/5616846e318ba9c42470e7cad03db5de6458b63c_2_421x562.jpeg 1.5x, https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/6/5616846e318ba9c42470e7cad03db5de6458b63c_2_562x750.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"87645F\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"aspect-ratio: 281 / 375;\"></div><br>\nGathering the necessary components for project at our electrical corner.<p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/a/5af7aef6ea46faa62294f87af3dd38ccefc80c46_2_281x375.jpeg\" alt=\"Preparing circuit design.\" data-base62-sha1=\"cYJDaeL8M1w7PO8heat53m6wLYy\" width=\"281\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/a/5af7aef6ea46faa62294f87af3dd38ccefc80c46_2_281x375.jpeg, https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/a/5af7aef6ea46faa62294f87af3dd38ccefc80c46_2_421x562.jpeg 1.5x, https://metastudio.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/a/5af7aef6ea46faa62294f87af3dd38ccefc80c46_2_562x750.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"7B6D5B\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"aspect-ratio: 281 / 375;\"></div><br>\nPreparing circuit design for the  project, the process goes on.<p></p>\n<p>The team then assembled the alarm buzzer.
